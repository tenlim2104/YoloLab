        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Load the model\n",
        "First of all, you need to load a model to use it for object detection. You can decide which model you want to use, depending on the task you want to perform. You can find a list of available pre-trained models [here](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/) and [here](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/). These models have been trained on a large dataset of 80 different objects and are accurate enough for many use cases. However, as we will look at later, you can also train or fine-tune your own model and use it the same way.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As you can see in the graph above, the YOLO archtecture is constantly evolving and there are different model generations (e.g. YOLOV8, YOLOV10), that try to improve the detection accuracy and efficiency. The Y-Axis shows the mAP (mean average precision) of the model using a standardized dataset (COCO). This is a measure of the detection accuracy. The X-Axis shows the model size and inference time, which is a measure of the speed of the model. There are different sizes of each model (e.g. nano, small, medium, balanced, large, xlarge). The larger the model, the more accurate it is, while also being slower and requiring more memory. Furthermore, there also is a diminishing return with larger models, so they cannot be infinitely scaled. Depending on your use case and hardware, you need to choose the right model and find the balance between speed and accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Inference\n",
        "Inference is the process of using the model to make predictions on new data. You can do this with a wide variety of [input sources](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/#inference-sources) like images, videos, live streams, that are supported out of the box. Most popular [image and video formats](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/#image-and-video-formats) are supported. Using [inference arguments](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/#inference-arguments), you can customize the inference process (e.g. which classes to detect, confidence threshold, etc.) and the visualization. The `predict()` call returns a list of Results objects.\n",

        "### 3. Process the results\n",
        "The ```predict()``` call returns a list of Results objects, that contain the detected objects. You can access the detected objects by iterating over the results and accessing the bounding boxes and other information. This is heavily dependent on the task you are trying to solve, so we will look at it later with several exercises. Below is a simple function to plot the detected objects on an image that you can use to visualize the results."

        "Now that you have mastered the basics of object detection with YOLO, it's time to train your own model! You have been tasked by a ski resort in the Grisons mountain to develop a system that can detect and count the number of skiers on the ski slopes in real-time. Because of this, we need to train our custom YOLO model.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "### Transfer learning\n",
        "While you could train a model from scratch it is often much more efficient to use an existing model and fine-tune it on your own dataset. This process, where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task, is called transfer learning. Since the model has already learned to detect and classify objects in images, it can be relatively easily be adapteded to detect new objects, that it hasn't seen before. Transfer learning is widely used, because it uses much less training data, trains much faster and often achieves better performance than training a model from scratch.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset\n",
        "In order to train our custom YOLO model, we need a dataset of labeled images with the objects we want to classify. This is what we call supervised learning. There are many datasets with thousands of images available online, that are already labeled and can be used or expanded. Some of them are generic, while others are application specific (e.g. medical imaging, aerial imaging, self-driving cars etc.). Here are two examples of popular datasets:\n",
        "* https://cocodataset.org/#explore\n",
        "* https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html\n",
        "\n",
        "The COCO dataset for example, that was used to train the original YOLO model contains images of 80 popular objects. Take a minute to look at the website and see how the images are labelled. For this exercise however, we want to create our own dataset from scratch. Creating your own dataset can be a very time consuming process. Fortunately, there are a lot of images of skiers available online, that we can use for our model.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Real data can be hard to collect (e.g. a defect in a production line that only occurs very rarely)\n",
        "* The amount of different objects to detect is very large\n",
        "* The amount of objects will grow over time and the model needs to be retrained with new data\n",
        "* ...\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, labelling can also be difficult. In some cases, not even experts can agree on the correct label (e.g. for classifying a defect). In these cases, it can help to generate synthetic data. This is data that is artificially created by a computer program (e.g. by rendering a scene). Once setup, synthetic data can be generated in large quantities with different lighting conditions, backgrounds, positioning, etc. which is perfect for training our models. Since the ground truth is known, the labels can be generated automatically. Therefore it can be very useful for training a model and - depending of the application - save you a lot of time. How you generate the data is highly dependent on the task you are trying to solve. You can several example of the usage of synthetic data [here](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/). Depending on the task, you can also use relatively simple methods to create synthetic data, like in [this study on tomato detection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426829/).\n",

        "The model performs well on images/videos that are similar to the training data, however if you test it on images/videos that are different from the training data, the performance is not very good. For example with a video from a ski race from the perspective of a drone/helicopter or with different lighting/weather, the skiers are not reliably recognized. In order to improve the model, it's always good to have a diverse dataset with images from different perspectives, lighting conditions, etc. This way the model can generalize better and perform well on unseen data. Large datasets (e.g. the COCO dataset used to train YOLO) can contain tens of thousands of images, which takes a lot of effort to create and label. So generally speaking, you have to test the model and see how it performs on your specific use case and then decide if you need more data to improve the model or not.\n",

        "After you have trained your model, you can now deploy it in the field. While training models is computationally very expensive, inference can be done with a lot less compute power. For example, YOLO can even run low-power devices like smartphones, if they have hardware acceleration. The YOLOv8s model runs at 80 FPS on a Raspberry Pi 5 with AI kit using only 6W of power. Without AI accelerator, the model can also run on the CPU, however performance is limited at around [1 FPS](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/raspberry-pi/#__tabbed_2_2), which can still be useful, depending on the application.\n",

This approach offers benefits like improved privacy (since data doesn’t leave the device), reduced latency (quicker response times), and lower ongoing costs. However, edge devices typically have higher power draw and larger upfront cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, cloud computing refers to using remote servers for processing. Cloud services provide scalable power, ideal for more intensive or burst workloads, but they come with recurring costs, higher latency, a need for constant connectivity and can be a privacy concern. This can be useful, if you want very low cost- and power hardware and have the connectivity, to send data to the cloud for processing or want to use very large models (e.g. ChatGPT).\n",

        "As you saw with the exercises, the hardware you use can have a significant impact on model speed. There are many different hardware accelerators for AI (GPU, TPU, NPU, FPGA, …) and unfortunately, a lot of software only works with specific hardware architecture. For example the Ultralytics YOLO library only works with NVIDIA and not AMD graphics cards out of the box. Because of this, there are open standards like ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange), that can help with converting and makes running models on different hardware a lot easier. You can see the command to convert a model to ONNX below."
